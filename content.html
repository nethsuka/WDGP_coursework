                        <p>
                            These are disposable plastic items designed for one-time or short-term use, 
                            such as plastic bags, straws, bottles, and packaging. Due to their durability and 
                            widespread use, they often end up as litter in the environment, especially in marine ecosystems.
                            Ocean gyres are large systems of circulating currents that concentrate debris, including plastic, 
                            in specific areas of the ocean. The most well-known example is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, 
                            located between Hawaii and California. Plastic accumulation in these gyres poses significant 
                            threats to marine life and ecosystems.

                        <h3>Oil Spills</h3><br>
                        <p>
                            Many things can lead to oil spills, such as mishaps during the extraction process, 
                            transportation incidents (like tanker collisions or groundings), offshore drilling operations, 
                            and natural occurrences like oil seeps or volcanic eruptions. However, these can have 
                            disastrous effects on marine life, including fish, birds, marine mammals, and coral reefs. 
                            Oil can suffocate marine creatures by blocking their gills and coats the feathers of birds 
                            and the fur of marine mammals, resulting in hypothermia.

                        <h3>Chemical Pollution</h3><br>
                        <p>
                            Industrial processes, agricultural runoff, sewage discharge, maritime operations, 
                            and atmospheric deposition are the main sources of chemical pollution in coastal settings. 
                            Chemical pollutants can build up in the tissues of marine organisms through processes such as 
                            bioaccumulation, which occurs when pollutants accumulate in an organism's body over time, 
                            and biomagnification, which occurs when concentrations of pollutants rise at higher trophic 
                            levels in the food chain. This will produce harmful toxins to marine life and humans.
